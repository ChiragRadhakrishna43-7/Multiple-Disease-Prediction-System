# Multiple-Disease-Prediction-System
Facilitates disease prediction by diagnosing user symptoms.

The multiple disease prediction system is a machine learning-based web application. It makes use of machine learning algorithms to analyze user symptoms and determine whether or not the user is suffering from a particular disease.
Existing systems that facilitate early disease detection make use of either technical parameters or questionnaires. These existing formats are tedious or are presented in a way that is difficult for users to understand. Given the sensitivity of the issue at hand, namely disease prediction, this application has employed simply worded symptoms as a crucial construct.

The web-application has been deployed using the Streamlit framework. Streamlit is a Python framework that makes it easy to create web applications for data science and machine learning projects. It facilitates the creation of interactive web apps with just a few lines of code, and it's designed to be intuitive and easy to use.
